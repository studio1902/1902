            text: ', I was approached by Robin Smithuis, a retired doctor from the Netherlands. His brother Frank runs a development organization in Myanmar with his wife Ni Ni to improve healthcare and make it more accessible. During this project, the coup d''Ã©tat in Myanmar took place. It was heartbreaking to read and hear what all happened and how it affected Frank and the charity. Add the covid crisis to that. The regime made it impossible for him to do his job.'

            text: 'I ended up designing a new site based on what was already there. I was able to derive the wishes from Frank and Robin''s concepts and convert them into an attractive design. At a later stage we added a donation module, with which they already raised 50,000 euros in a few months. This allows Frank and Ni Ni to open more clinics and train local people. I love nothing more than to contribute with my expertise to such great causes.'
