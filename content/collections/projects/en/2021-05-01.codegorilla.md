            text: 'An inclusive labor market and enriching ICT: that is what CodeGorilla stands for. They organize coding bootcamps for motivated job seekers who want to learn the programming profession and then match them with employers. The design is by Merkactivisten (Brand Activists), who already did a complete rebranding at an earlier stage. The site has been professionalized and personalized: from now on, CodeGorilla mainly focuses on finding participants online.'
