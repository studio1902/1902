They looked neat and there was a clear, appropriate visual style, but the desire was to be able to add more content. In addition, accessibility and search engine optimization had to improve. No sooner said than done. A new, accessible and fully customizable website with new visual elements. Highlight: you can read received tickets directly via the website. Enter the code and the website will retrieve the card via Spottery''s app. This lowers the threshold for potential users.'
