I have a big focus on usability and accessibility. At the same time, I understand that websites must perform well to contribute to marketing goals. Fortunately, managing your website is a piece of cake, because I know how you can use Statamic for this. That also applies to front-end development: I like to create that extra animation or that effect that benefits the User Interface.'
