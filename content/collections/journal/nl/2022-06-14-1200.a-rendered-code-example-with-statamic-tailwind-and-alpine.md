title: 'A rendered code example with Statamic, Tailwind and Alpine'
description: 'For recent journal entries about SVG clipping masks and animating clipping masks I wanted to render actual code examples in the article to show the reader what the end result of the tutorial would like. Since I use the Tailwind CSS JIT compiler my website ships with a CSS file that contains only the classes that are actually being used in my template files. That seems very restricting as I would probably always use some unavailable class in my examples. So I came up with a solution that utilizes the Tailwind Play CDN to live parse the code snippet and return the CSS needed.'
