This is how I prefer to develop my websites as it leaves me in control and on a per site basis I can tailor everything to different demands. '

We want Statamic to generate different sizes for each image so we can serve users the lowest image resolution possible depending on their device without sacrificing image quality. Statamic uses the Glide library for this. Luckily Glide can also convert images to WebP. So let’s throw that in their as well.'
